      I Believe This Layout To Be Finished AS OF NOW, It Is Indeed Rescalable With The Window, Janky But It Works
   2. Compatibility [ðŸŸ¢]

      Imported My Clearvision Theme Into It, And It Looks Great With Tweaks On The Title Bar

      Currently Thinking, I Need To Finish The Layout's Scalability Before Getting To QoL Adjustments
